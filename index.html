        <h2>Trends in State Prisoner Statistics</h2>
        <p>The following report explores trends in prisoner statistics for inmates in the United States under state 
          correctional authority.  Most of the data used for this analysis came from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,
          and a few other sources that were used to shed light on trends in the BJS data.
        </p>

        <p>The results of an exploratory data analysis suggest that there are correlations between race and type of offense
          that inmates are serving time for.  Additionally, the proportion of Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics serving time in
          the U.S. state prisons do not match up with the racial breakdown of the overall U.S. population.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, the analysis demonstrates that each state in the U.S. has slightly different levels of imprisonment with 
          respect to the state's population.  States such as Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Arizona have high imprisonment rates
          compared to the average, while California, New York New Jersey, and others have relatively low imprisonment rates.

          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There appears to be a significant correlation in which the states with a higher percentage of their population
            in poverty also leads to a higher percentage of population that lacks healthcare, are smokers, and are also obese.
            This would lead one to assume that the states with the higher percentage of population living in poverty would have 
            a higher percentage of unhealthy people in general.
          </p>

          <p>There does not appear to be any significant correlation between the median age of a states population an the 
            percentage of the population that lacks healthcare or is obese. There does appear to be a slight correlation
            between the median age and the percentage of smokers. Median age may not be the best indicator to use in order 
            to determine the overall health of a population.
          </p>

          <p>There appears to be a significant correlation in which the states with a higher household median income have 
            significantly less of their percentage of population that lack healthcare, are smokers, and are obese. This could 
            lead one to assume that the states with the higher the median income of the population in a given state would have 
            a higher percentage of healthy people compared to states with a smaller household median income.</p>
